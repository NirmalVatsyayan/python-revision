Multithreaded Priority Queue
The Queue module allows you to create a new queue object that can hold a 
specific number of items. There are following methods to control the Queue âˆ’

get(): The get() removes and returns an item from the queue.

put(): The put adds item to a queue.

qsize() : The qsize() returns the number of items that are currently in the queue.

empty(): The empty( ) returns True if queue is empty; otherwise, False.

full(): the full() returns True if queue is full; otherwise, False.
