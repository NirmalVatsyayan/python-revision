'''
threading.activeCount()  - Returns the number of thread objects that are active.
threading.currentThread()- Returns the number of thread objects in the caller's thread control.
threading.enumerate()    - Returns a list of all thread objects that are currently active.


run(): The run() method is the entry point for a thread.
start(): The start() method starts a thread by calling the run method.
join([time]): The join() waits for threads to terminate.
isAlive(): The isAlive() method checks whether a thread is still executing.
getName(): The getName() method returns the name of a thread.
setName(): The setName() method sets the name of a thread.



Creating Thread Using Threading Module
    To implement a new thread using the threading module,
    you have to do the following âˆ’

        Define a new subclass of the Thread class.

        Override the __init__(self [,args]) method to add additional arguments.

        Then, override the run(self [,args]) method to implement what the thread 
        should do when started.

        Once you have created the new Thread subclass, you can create an instance 
        of it and then start a new thread by invoking the start(), which in turn calls 
        run() method.
